\section{Conclusions}

Big data systems are not as performant as they could be.
While this is true of all systems, the scale that such systems operate at means that any performance gap can translate into a large amount of money.
At the same time, large distributed systems are not as easy to measure and instrument as single-box systems.
Thus, we believe it crucial for new tools and processes to be developed for monitoring their performance.

We also believe having an expressive general-purpose language like C\# or Java integrated into a big data query language is a good thing: programmers should be able to re-use existing components in languages that they are already comfortable with.
However, such multi-language paradigms break the barriers that current program analysis and optimization tools are based on.

We have shown some techniques for measuring data center peformance and the utility of even small, simple optimizations.
Clearly, we have just scratched the surface of two very promising research areas.
