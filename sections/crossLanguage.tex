\section{Cross-Language Optimizations}
Cross-language optimizations can result in two different changes to the generated program that executes a query.

\subsection{Optimizations With Effects On Job Algebra}
The first changes the physical plan, i.e., the job algebra, because more information is
made available to the query optimizer.
For example, predicates might be pushed deeper into the DAG which can result in dramatic data reduction.


\subsection{Optimizations Without Effects On Job Algebra}
The second is that, for SCOPE, the set of intrinsics means that by lifting more non-relational code into the parts of the program where such things are visible to the optimizer, more code can be executed in C++ instead of in C\#.
So even though the physical plan has not changed, the resulting program might be might more efficient since it avoids the native to managed transition.
