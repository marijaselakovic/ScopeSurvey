\section{Future Work \label{sec:future}}

We plan to pursue several avenues in the near future.
First, we would like to do a broader set of experiments.
Even our limited case studies point out the powerfulness of inlining UDFs, it would be beneficial to prune out jobs which do not benefit from such optimization. 

Furthermore, we would like to explore ways to relax the restrictions on which methods we can inline.
In particular, user-defined operators (UDOs) consume an inordinate amount of time in each data center: being able to optimize them could provide a very large benefit.

Finally, exploiting other optimizations in the context of big data jobs at Microsoft is also left for future work.
