\section{Future Work \label{sec:future}}

We plan to pursue several avenues in the near future.
First, we would like to do a broader set of experiments.
Even our limited case studies point out that, while it may not hurt, it may not be especially beneficial to inline UDFs.
It would be good to know what other optimizations are more important in such jobs.
