\section{Future Work \label{sec:future}}

We plan to pursue several avenues in the near future.
First, we would like to do a broader set of experiments.
Even our limited case studies point out that, while it may not hurt, it may not be especially beneficial to inline UDFs.
It would be good to know what other optimizations are more important in such jobs.

We would also like to explore ways to relax the restrictions on which methods we can inline.
In particular, user-defined operators (UDOs) consume an inordinate amount of time in each data center: being able to optimize them could provide a very large benefit.
