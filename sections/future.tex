\section{Future Work \label{sec:future}}

We plan to pursue several avenues in the near future.
First, we would like to do a broader set of experiments.
Even in our limited case studies we found that it is not always beneficial to
inline UDFs.
It would be necessary to have an analysis that can predict when to perform the optimization. 

Furthermore, we would like to explore ways to relax the restrictions on which methods we can inline.
In particular, user-defined operators (UDOs) consume an inordinate amount of time in each data center: being able to optimize them could provide a very large benefit.

Finally, exploiting other optimizations in the context of big data jobs at Microsoft is also left for future work.
