\section{Case Studies}
In order to quantify the effects of optimizing the scripts, we performed a case study.
We say that a C\# method is {\em intrinsicable} if it is a .NET Framework method for which the SCOPE compiler has a semantically equivalent C++ function.
The jobs were chosen based on a static analysis that found {\em optimizable vertices}.
An optimizable vertex is one that is implemented in C\#, but the C\# code calls only intrinsicable methods or user-defined functions, {\em UDFs}, where the UDF, in turn, calls only intrinsicable methods, and does not call any other UDFs, i.e., our inlining depth is one.
Furthermore, we identified a job as being of interest if it contains an optimizable vertex was responsible for X\% of the total job's time.
{\bf mb:[Marija, is that true? Or did we just care about the cost of the job?]}
We categorized the jobs by how long they ran for: short, medium, and long.
{\bf mb:[Marija, do you have any stats about the distribution of PnHours? Are there really just three buckets? [0,100), [100,1000), and [1000,...)?]}

Because the input data for each job is not available, we needed to contact the job owners and ask them to re-run the job with a manually-inlined version of their script.
We were able to have 12 jobs re-run by their owners.

We illustrate the difference that replacing a C\# vertex with a C++ vertex can make.
Job A is a medium-expensive job that runs daily.
It contains one vertex that had been implemented in  C\# because of a single user-defined function.
Inlining that one function resulted in the entire vertex being executed in C++.
Figure~\ref{fig:CaseStudyA} shows the CPU time for that vertex over an 18 day period, the last 5 of which were with the inlined UDF.
The values are all normalized by the average of the unoptimized execution times; the optimized version saves approximately 60\% of the execution time.

For the other 11 jobs, we were not able to perform the same kind of historical study.
Instead we have at most one execution of the optimized script.
